[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4mqtucv6ks4peakf/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Astropy/ci-helpers/branch/master)

This repository contains a set of scripts that are used by the
``.travis.yml`` and ``appveyor.yml`` files of astropy packages for the
[Travis](http://travis-ci.org) and [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/)
services respectively.

The idea is to clone these at the last minute when the continuous
integration is about to be run. This is better than including this
repository as a sub-module, because this allows updates to this repository
to take effect immediately, and not have to update the sub-module every time
a change is made.

How to use
----------

### Travis

Include the following lines at the start of the ``install`` section in ``.travis.yml``:

```yaml
install:
    - git clone git://github.com/astropy/ci-helpers.git
    - source ci-helpers/travis/setup.sh
```

This does the following:

- Set up Miniconda
- Set up the PATH appropriately
- Set up a conda environment named 'test' and switch to it
- Set the ``always_yes`` config option for conda to ``true`` so that you don't need to include ``--yes``
- Register the specified channels, or if not stated the ``astropy`` and ``astropy-ci-extras`` channels
- ``export PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF8``

Following this, various dependencies are installed depending on the following environment variables

* ``MAIN_CMD``: if this starts with ``pep8``, then the only package that gets
  installed is the ``pep8`` package.

* ``SETUP_CMD``: this can be set to various values:

    * ``egg_info``: no dependencies are installed once the conda environment
      has been created and any other environment variables are ignored.

    * ``build_sphinx`` or ``build_docs``: the Sphinx and matplotlib packages
      are installed in addition to other packages that might be requested
      via other environment variables.

    * ``test``: runs the test suite after the dependencies are installed.

  In addition, if ``SETUP_CMD`` contains the following flags, extra dependencies are installed:

    * ``--coverage``: the coverage and coveralls packages are installed
    * ``--parallel``: the pytest-xdist package is installed
    * ``--open-files``: the psutil package is installed

* ``$NUMPY_VERSION``: if set to ``dev`` or ``development``, the latest
  developer version of Numpy is installed along with Cython. If set to a
  version number, that version is installed. If set to ``stable``, install
  the latest stable version of Numpy.

* ``$ASTROPY_VERSION``: if set to ``dev`` or ``development``, the latest
  developer version of Astrop is installed, along with Cython and jinja2,
  which are compile-time dependencies. If set to a version number, that
  version is installed. If set to ``stable``, install the latest stable
  version of Astropy. If set to ``lts`` the latest long term support (LTS)
  version is installed (more info about LTS can be found
  [here](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE2.rst#version-numbering).

* ``$CONDA_DEPENDENCIES``: this should be a space-separated string of
  package names that will be installed with conda. Version numbers of these
  dependencies can be overriden/specified with the ``$PACKAGENAME_VERSION``
  environment variables.

* ``$PIP_DEPENDENCIES``: this should be a space-separated string of package
  names that will be installed with pip.

* ``CONDA_DEPENDENCIES_FLAGS``: additional flags to pass to conda when
  installing ``CONDA_DEPENDENCIES``

* ``PIP_DEPENDENCIES_FLAGS``: additional flags to pass to pip when
  installing ``PIP_DEPENDENCIES``

* ``$CONDA_CHANNELS``: this should be a space-separated string of conda
  channel names, and defaults to ``astropy`` and ``astropy-ci-extras``.

* ``$DEBUG``: if `True` this turns on the shell debug mode in the install
  scripts, and provides information on the current conda install and
  switches off the ``-q`` conda flag for verbose output.

* ``$SETUP_XVFB``: if True this makes sure e.g., interactive matplotlib
  backends work by starting up a X virtual framebuffer.

* ``$PACKAGENAME_VERSION``: ``PACKAGENAME`` is the name of the package to
  specify the version for (e.g. ``MATPLOTLIB_VERSION``). Due to shell
  limitations, all hyphens in the conda package name should be changed to
  underscores in ``$PACKAGENAME_VERSION`` (e.g. for scikit-image it should
  be ``SCIKIT_IMAGE_VERSION``). If specified it will override any version
  number limitations listed in ``$CONDA_DEPENDENCIES``.


The idea behind the ``MAIN_CMD`` and ``SETUP_CMD`` environment variables is
that the ``script`` section of the ``.travis.yml`` file can be set to:

```
script:
    - $MAIN_CMD $SETUP_CMD
```

The typical usage will then be to set ``$MAIN_CMD`` to default to ``python
setup.py`` and then set ``$SETUP_CMD='test'``, and this then allows special
builds that have ``$MAIN_CMD='pep8'`` and ``$SETUP_CMD=''``.

Packages can also choose to not use the ``$MAIN_CMD`` variable and instead to set the ``script`` section to:

```
script:
    - python setup.py $SETUP_CMD
```

and simply adjust ``$SETUP_CMD`` as needed.

Following the set-up, if additional packages need to be installed, the
``$CONDA_INSTALL`` environment variable should be used to make sure that the
Python and Numpy versions stay fixed to those requested, e.g.

```
- $CONDA_INSTALL another_package
```

### AppVeyor

Include the following lines at the start of the ``install`` section in ``appveyor.yml``:

```yaml
install:
    - "git clone git://github.com/astropy/ci-helpers.git"
    - "powershell ci-helpers/appveyor/install-miniconda.ps1"
    - "SET PATH=%PYTHON%;%PYTHON%\\Scripts;%PATH%"
    - "activate test"
```

This does the following:

- Set up Miniconda
- Set up the PATH appropriately
- Set up a conda environment named 'test' and switch to it
- Set the ``always_yes`` config option for conda to ``true`` so that you don't need to include ``--yes``
- Register the ``astropy-ci-extras`` channel

Following this, various dependencies are installed depending on the following environment variables

* ``$NUMPY_VERSION``: if set to ``dev`` or ``development``, the latest
  developer version of Numpy is installed along with Cython. If set to a
  version number, that version is installed.  If set to ``stable``, install
  the latest stable version of Numpy.

* ``$ASTROPY_VERSION``: if set to ``dev`` or ``development``, the latest
  developer version of Astrop is installed, along with Cython and jinja2,
  which are compile-time dependencies. If set to a version number, that
  version is installed. If set to ``stable``, install the latest stable
  version of Astropy. If set to ``lts`` the latest long term support (LTS)
  version is installed (more info about LTS can be found
  [here](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE2.rst#version-numbering).

* ``$CONDA_DEPENDENCIES``: this should be a space-separated string of package
  names that will be installed with conda.

Details
-------

The scripts include:

* ``appveyor/install-miniconda.ps1`` - set up conda on Windows
* ``appveyor/windows_sdk.cmd`` - set up the compiler environment on Windows
* ``travis/setup_dependencies_common.sh`` - set up conda packages on Linux and MacOS X
* ``travis/setup_conda_linux.sh`` - set up conda on Linux
* ``travis/setup_conda_osx.sh`` - set up conda on MacOS X

This repository can be cloned directly from the ``.travis.yml`` and
``appveyor.yml`` files when about to run tests and does not need to be
included as a sub-module in repositories.
